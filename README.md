# Light-Bounce-Game-Final
My final project for ENGR103
Rules: light bounces between the left and right buttons along the lights, if it passes them, then the game is over. The delay speed gets faster as the game continues, and the score increases with every correct input. The left button must be pushed if the light moves left, and the right button must be pushed if the light heads right.
Inputs: right button adds score and sets the light to move left. Left button adds score and sets light to move right. Slide sets the gamestate to 0 and acts as a pause.
Outputs: Lights indicate where the light is and how long you have left to press the button. The speaker plays a noise every time the button is correctly hit. Serial monitor prints the score. Score increases with every correct hit. Speedvalue decreases with every correct hit.
